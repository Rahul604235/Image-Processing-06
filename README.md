# DFT, Magnitude-Phase Dominance.

1. Implement 2D DFT using row-column decomposition.
2. Compute DFTs F1(k,l) = |F1(k,l)|e^[jφ_1(k,l)] and F2(k,l) = |F2(k,l)|e^[jφ_2(k,l)] of I1(fourier.pgm)
and I2 (fourier transform.pgm) respectively. Arrive at two new images I3 and I4 such that
their DFTs are, respectively, F3(k,l) = |F1(k,l)|e^[jφ_2(k,l)] and F4(k,l) = |F2(k,l)|e^[jφ_1(k,l)].
